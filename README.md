This project is to compile samples of my programming experience.

I plan to learn GitHub to build this repository up to showcase my current skillset and set a focus towards my development.

As of January, 2026, the language i am most familiar with is Microsoft VBA as i have been using it for my job.

I have experience with Java, C# from my graduate degree program.
I am intending to add additional folders / branches to include code written in other languages.
Eventually i plan to build working projects that can showcase my skills and that can be utilized on UpWork.
